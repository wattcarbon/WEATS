# How to Submit a Methodology

_This guide walks you through how to submit your methodology onto this WEATS document repository. The way this works in github is it creates a copy of the WEATS repository into your account. You will then make changes to your copy of the WEATS repository, and then submit a Pull Request, which represents a change that you would like to make to the primary WEATS repository._

### 1. Write up your methodology in whatever text document you are most comfortable with. Our document repository is this Github repository, which renders documents in a format called Markdown, so it would be easiest to write your methodology in that format. However, these instructions include a way to convert any text to markdown if you wrote them in Google Docs or Microsoft Word.

### 2. To submit your methodology, you will create a Pull Request on our WEATS github repository. The simplest way to do that is to first attempt to create a new file directly on the repository. You can do that by clicking the “+” Sign to the right of the “Go to file” button. Then click “Create new file”, as shown below.

### 4. You will end up with a page that allows you to paste in your methodology in markdown. If you wrote your methodology in Microsoft Word or Google Docs, you can use [this website](https://gdoc2md.com/) to convert it to Markdown.

#### Make sure to fill out the “Name your file” with a file that ends with the suffix “.md”. This will allow you to use the “Edit” and “Preview” button to toggle between the raw Markdown and how it will be rendered on Github.![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdMSswetj5f0tL0g2bveBFTQWYQYV9SdtCCGE2L7XizxDXh6_dRaYsXjhJYlrsB19zB8yXFUBBBeSeVB5UqKrYgMkTPjwAB6_PBbZjD6w7DjlQDMmY3-fFqc5_u1HAaeHPqVHWctKiKr9VO4J5bNCWJmp_V?key=aRRrnxOzZnP06EN6jI_DLw)

#### Paste your methodology into the document. When you click Preview, you should see your methodology rendered in a way that resembles what it looked like in the Google Doc.

### 5. When you are done, click the green “Commit Changes…” button and a pop-up will appear. You don’t need to write anything in this description, a later step will provide an opportunity for you to explain your proposed methodology and any additional information you think reviewers might need. When you have completed this, click “Propose changes”

### 7. This will redirect you to a page that will allow you to add information that will be publicly shown alongside the methodology. This is where you can provide a summary of the methodology as well as any additional information you’d want reviewers to see. This can even include supplementary files. When you are done, click the “Create pull request” and a pull request will show up in the WEATS repository for review!
