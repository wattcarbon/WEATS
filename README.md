# Welcome to WEATS - the WattCarbon Energy Attribute Tracking System

This is the homepage for the current versions of the methodologies that allow WattCarbon to create EACs for clean energy resources. Each methodology category is contained in a separate folder. Individual methodologies are added by Pull Request ([step-by-step guide](https://github.com/wattcarbon/WEATS/blob/main/how-to-submit.md)). After the maintainers see the new Pull Request, it will be added to the queue below. Upon approval by the OpenEAC Alliance, these methodologies are merged into this repository and published here.


The OpenEAC Alliance is a volunteer organization comprised of individuals and organizations with experience developing measurement and verification techniques. Each methodology may be reviewed by one or more members of the OpenEAC Alliance and each change to a methodology will require notification of all reviewers.

See the current [Pull Requests](https://github.com/wattcarbon/WEATS/pulls) list for what is being considered by the OpenEAC Alliance.
